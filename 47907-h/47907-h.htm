<h2><a name="PREFISS" id="PREFISS">PREFISS.</a></h2>


<p>There is two kinds of prefisses one if it is by
yourself and the other if you get a swell riter
to do it for you. <em>I'm</em> going to do it by myself because
I have done the talk undeneath the picktures
so nice that I think people would be
greviously diseppointed if M<sup>r</sup>. Andrew Lang or
someboddy was to do it instead like he did for Sybil
Corbetts book (thats the other little girl
what <em>started</em> "Animal Land"). He did it awfull
nice of course and then you can get such nice
things into it about your grate tallent and
your emaggynation if <em>he</em> does it. He is so lerned
and drags in illusions to <em>other</em> grate authers but
when you can auth as nice as what I can there
isnt realy no need. If you do it yourself you
must appolergise for it all (they allways do) and
say it shall not accurr again. I am quite at
the openning of my corea (I saw that in the papers)
so I want ellowances made for my stile and imperfect
penship—I want it all put down to <em>yewth</em>.</p>

<p>I have done allmost all the most knowtable
Animals—you cant do evryboddy when youve got
musick and depportment to do too.</p>

<p>(I never thaught I would get to riting a Preffiss
but it is <em>abserdly</em> easey.)</p>

<p>P.S. I lernt to <em>draw</em> off the Veenus of Mealo and that
doesnt help you very much with <em>these</em> picktures. They
are mostly a diffrent stile of art alltogether.</p>

bed and asleep. He gets all the powder and baynits
and cammerers and repporters ready and it can
all be in the papers the same day. Then he prases
everyboddy else for fiting so nobbly—it sounds
just like Waterlew—but somehow there is not
so very many killed though it does look so terrible in
the lime-lite. That is his cleverness I expeckt.
Parlyment allways thanks him for it—he certanly
does make a neat job of it and he has such a nice

<p>This big friendly Creature is very shrood
and saggacious. If he finds a footprint
he can tell you what colored hair it has
and whether it is a libbral or a conservetive—which
is very clever I think.
He plays all games and always makes
a hundred. He likes to run through the
"Strand" with his tail in parts—all of
them strong and healthy—then he colects
it all together and it runs for a long time
by itself</p>

<p>This kind honnest Animal is very fond of dubblin
and like to play at billding a house on the green for
them to fite in. He is wearing the green right through
with trying so hard. When he is on the steemer
he nails things on to the mast. It is very odd he
sits for Scotland and stands up for Ireland. He is
a bewtifull talker and riter and goveness says he
is a "pewriss in stile" (watever <em>does</em> she mean). He
is strugling to learn the sord-dance over two umbrellas.
It is awfull hard though and he keeps all
on kicking his ankells till he has to sit down
on the flore—then he plays on the bag-pipes
like the heeros in India but the neybours do
complain so he will have to give it up or ellse
move into another districkt</p>

<p>This Animal has got a head full of rules and
reggulatians. It is awfull fond of all kinds of
riddles. the ones it likes best are those noboddy
cant make head or tail of—the abstuser the
better. They make your hair all come off to think
of them. He use to sit in a chair and see they all
behaved. He did it so nicely that they mesured him
for a bigger chair but it fitted someone else best
so he lives in a tub now like Diodgiknees. He
gives awfull nice lecktures to passers-by and says
order order to himself. He wants to have members
of parlyment all diffrent sizes according to the
waight of the voaters—he calls it "prepporshnal
repprisentatian" (I hope I have spellt it right) isnt
it silly. He is a leeder of fashion. He has got
a pattent westcote of a very funny colour that is
most becomming. They say he comes out all over
brass buttens at night—he must look radiently
bewtifull.</p>

<p>This curious little Creature never comes out
in the same place only about once a year—that
keeps his vallew up. They take him
round in a selloon carrige with his name
very large on the outside hermiticly seeld
and deckerated with maden-hare ferns and
rare browcades. They stop at the towns and let
him out to play for a few minutes and then all the
ladies in dabbly dresses weep and gassp and shreek
out "<em>Divvine</em>!" andsettra and rush about after him
till the pollice steps in—then they kiss the legs
of the piyanno and mone for a fortnight after.</p>

and gets under the sofer-cushions or inside the
peyanno or crawls in under the slates till it is
all over. He use to live in a old licht-house once.
He is a marvelus mixture of the most commical

a reggular Ramsgitsingey at cricket. He
was to have gone to Orstralia with M<sup>r</sup> Stodert
but they thought it was better for the Empire
that he should not. You should see him
snick them among the slippers (I hope that

all come close up to him just to take hints in
batting.</p>

a terrible fassinating kind of hero who goes out
to battle talking several langwages with a gardeeniya
and lavinder kid gloves on and carrying a ormerlew

little rings with his cigerret smoke while he conkuers

is very kind hearted to other Animals. She was
